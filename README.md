## How do AI PDF chat tools actually understand my documents?

These tools use natural language processing to analyze document structure, extract text, and build searchable indexes of your content. When you ask a question, the AI searches this index for relevant sections, then generates answers based on that context while maintaining links back to source locations.

## Can I trust the answers these tools provide?

Most reputable tools include citation systems showing exactly where information came from within your document. Always verify critical information by clicking through to the source sections—treat AI answers as starting points for research rather than final truth.

## What's the difference between free and paid plans?

Free tiers typically limit daily documents, total pages, or queries per day while providing basic functionality. Paid plans remove these restrictions, add advanced AI models like GPT-4, enable team collaboration features, and increase file size limits for handling larger documents.
